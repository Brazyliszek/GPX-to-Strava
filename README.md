# GPX to Strava
A fork of [GPX-to-Strava](https://github.com/SaturnXIII/GPX-to-Strava) with skipping the name and description part and selecting type of activity based on gpx file itself. Added uploaded activites logger so you won't have duplicates. Doesn't need user interaction except for API connect.
